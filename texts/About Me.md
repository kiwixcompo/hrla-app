# About Me

With over 25 years of experience in Employee Relations, Leave of Absence administration, and Risk Management, I’ve worked directly with employees and managers on some of the most sensitive and time-critical workplace issues.

Over that time, I’ve answered hundreds of leave-related questions involving medical leave, pregnancy, disability, accommodations, workers’ compensation, and return-to-work issues.

I built this HR Leave Assist tool to support my own HR work—helping me respond to leave questions clearly, consistently, and respectfully without starting from scratch each time.

Today, it helps HR professionals simplify complex leave conversations, reduce confusion, and respond with confidence when it matters most.

If you’re looking for a practical, HR-built resource to help you navigate leave questions with clarity and confidence, I invite you to take full advantage of this tool.

It’s designed to support your judgment—not replace it—and to help you respond accurately, consistently, and professionally when employees and managers need answers most.
