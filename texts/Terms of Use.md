# Terms of Use
**Effective Date:** January 2026

## 1. Purpose of the Service
HR Leave Assist (“HRLA”) is an informational, decision-support tool designed to assist human resources professionals in understanding employee leave, accommodation, and interactive process frameworks under **applicable federal and California law**.

HRLA provides **general informational guidance only**. It is not a substitute for professional judgment, legal counsel, medical certification, or determinations made by regulatory agencies.

## 2. No Legal, Medical, or Compliance Advice
HRLA does **not** provide:
* Legal advice
* Medical advice
* Final eligibility determinations
* Binding interpretations of statutes or regulations
* Guarantees of compliance

Use of HRLA does not create an attorney-client relationship, a medical provider-patient relationship, or any fiduciary duty. All employment decisions—including leave approval, accommodation determinations, interactive process outcomes, and return-to-work decisions—remain the sole responsibility of the employer.

## 3. California-Specific Limitations
California employment laws, including but not limited to the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), Pregnancy Disability Leave (PDL), the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), and related regulations, are **fact-specific, enforcement-driven, and subject to change**.

HRLA:
* Does not account for local ordinances, enforcement positions, or court interpretations
* Does not evaluate collective bargaining agreements, institutional policies, or employer-specific practices
* Does not replace required employer obligations such as the interactive process

Users are responsible for confirming current legal requirements and seeking legal advice when appropriate.

## 4. Federal Law Scope
For federal subscriptions, HRLA provides general informational guidance related to federal leave and accommodation frameworks, including the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

Federal guidance is subject to eligibility thresholds, factual nuance, and evolving interpretation. HRLA does not guarantee applicability to any specific employment situation.

## 5. Accuracy, Currency, and “As-Of” Information
HRLA reflects laws and guidance **generally in effect as of the date displayed within the tool**.

Employment laws and agency guidance may change without notice. HRLA does not represent that information is always current, complete, or applicable to every factual scenario.

## 6. Jurisdictional Scope
HRLA responses are limited to the jurisdiction selected by the user (California or federal). HRLA does not provide:
* Multi-state comparisons
* Conflict-of-law analysis
* Guidance outside the selected jurisdiction

## 7. User Responsibilities
Users agree that they will:
* Use HRLA for internal informational purposes only
* Exercise independent professional judgment
* Verify current laws and organizational policies
* Refrain from entering sensitive personal data, including but not limited to:
    * Social Security numbers
    * Medical records or diagnoses
    * Dates of birth

## 8. Subscription, Access, and Use
Access to HRLA is provided on a subscription basis. HRLA reserves the right to suspend or terminate access for:
* Non-payment
* Misuse
* Excessive or automated usage
* Violation of these Terms

## 9. Limitation of Liability
To the extent permitted by applicable law, HRLA and its operators disclaim liability for decisions, actions, penalties, claims, or damages arising from use of the service. HRLA is provided **“as is” and “as available,”** without warranties of any kind, express or implied.

## 10. Changes to the Service
HRLA may modify content, features, or availability at any time. Continued use constitutes acceptance of updated Terms.
