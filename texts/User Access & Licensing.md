# User Access, Licensing & Data Use

### What is this tool?
This is an internal HR support tool that helps HR teams draft clear, consistent responses to employee leave and accommodation questions. It does not make decisions, send emails, or replace HR judgment. It helps HR respond faster and more consistently.

### Who is allowed to use it?
Only authorized HR staff or designated administrators within the organization may use this tool. It is not for employees and should not be shared outside the organization.

### What does it help with?
The tool helps HR:
* Draft responses to employee leave questions
* Outline next steps in leave or accommodation situations
* Keep explanations clear, consistent, and professional
* Reduce the time spent rewriting the same answers
* **HR reviews and approves everything before it is used.**

### What does it NOT do?
This tool does not:
* Approve or deny leave
* Decide eligibility
* Calculate pay or benefits
* Store employee records
* Send messages to employees
* Replace HR systems or legal review

*Think of it as a smart drafting assistant, not an automated decision-maker.*

### Can employees use it directly?
**No.** Employees never interact with this tool directly. All use happens behind the scenes by HR.

### Does it store or remember employee data?
**No.** The tool does not save, remember, or build profiles on employees. Information entered is used only to generate a response in the moment.

### Is this a system of record?
**No.** It does not replace HR systems, payroll, benefits platforms, or document storage systems. All official records remain where they are today.

### Is it secure for internal use?
**Yes.** The tool is designed for internal business use only. Organizations control:
* Who has access
* What information is entered
* How outputs are used
* HR remains responsible for final review and communication.

### Can access be limited or removed?
**Yes.** Organizations decide who can use the tool and can remove access at any time.

### Can it be used across departments or locations?
**Yes**—within the same organization, as long as the correct version is used for the applicable rules or location.
